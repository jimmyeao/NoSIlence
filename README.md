First release, probably full of bugs...

The aim is to remove silence from the beginning and end of mp3 files, with a user adjustable limit for silence "volume".

To use this, you will need ffmpeg.exe https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

Drag and drop MP3 files into the window, or use Load button to browse for files

Click remove silence and you will be promtped to specify an output directory 

DO NOT USE THE SAME FOLDER AS THE SOURCE - IT WILL DELETE YOUR ORIGINALS IF YOU DO (To be fixed)
